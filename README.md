# React + Vite

1-This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
2-Project has different sections to work in.
3-We are using sass for styling in this project.
4-using sass we can write css inside parent css.

<!-- example
 .navbar{
    height: 100px;

    .wrapper{
        max-width: 1366px;
        margin: auto;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: space-between;
    }
}wrapper is inside navbar which is parent css for navbar component -->

5-For animation we are using framer motion.
